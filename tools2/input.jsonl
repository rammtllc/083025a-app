{"text": "1907.380  Yes."}
{"text": "1907.800  You think the value of your signature would go down more than the price of two tickets to Canada?"}
{"text": "1911.840  Ostensibly."}
{"text": "1912.480  That word doesn't work there."}
{"text": "1913.780  Steven!"}

{"text": "1943.120  Oh yeah."}
{"text": "1943.760  Hey, can I borrow your phone?"}
{"text": "1945.000  For what?"}
{"text": "1945.680  Uh, to set up my new service."}

{"text": "1965.060  Shh, shh."}
{"text": "1965.480  Um, yes."}
{"text": "1966.100  I would like to get a phone plan with no -term contract, please."}
{"text": "1968.860  All right, Rogers has just introduced a new plan."}
{"text": "1971.140  Uh -huh."}
