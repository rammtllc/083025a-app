0.000  I'm gonna be a little bit of a bitch.
2.680  Wake up in the morning looking greener than shrek.
6.280  Where is that donkey?
7.180  Sleeping in a tub can really mess up your neck.
10.640  Before I leave, I stop and vomit up tequila and glitter.
14.440  It seems I'm spending every morning with my head in the shit.
18.840  Got vomit up in my hair, but I'm way too sick to care.
22.700  Now I'm falling down the stairs.
26.500  I pull myself off the floor.
28.660  Then I'm almost out the door.
30.640  But my family is waiting for me.
34.760  Oh crap, not again.
36.680  It's an intervention.
38.800  It's cool.
39.660  I'm fine.
40.620  I can stop it any time.
42.720  That's a lie.
43.600  You won't try.
44.660  Now you've made your mother cry.
46.800  Look.
47.360  Oh.
49.020  Oh.
50.380  I'm outta here.
51.640  This is queer.
52.700  I'll just drink a couple beers.
54.940  Don't leave.
55.620  We love you.
56.520  We even hired Dr.
58.340  Drew.
58.880  This pattern needs to end.
60.680  I think I have to puke again.
63.440  Oh, whoa.
64.240  Oh.
65.140  Oh.
66.200  Oh.
66.820  So I decide to stay, but my head is still reeling.
70.700  Then they all go down the line talking about their feelings.
74.500  It makes me sad when I see you brush your teeth with Jack.
78.580  Also, you borrowed Michael Mike and never gave it back.
83.160  Stop showing off your butt.
84.380  You're making young girls act like sluts.
86.660  And you're starting to get a beer gut.
89.160  Beer gut.
90.940  This behavior's a dead end.
92.880  And P.
93.240  Dinny is not your friend.
94.900  You'll end up like Lindsay Lohan.
97.200  Luh, luh, luh, luh, luh.
98.560  This is whack.
99.620  I feel trapped.
100.480  We want the old Kesha back.
102.620  Screw you, Dr.
104.320  Drew, and your stupid camera crew.
106.680  Hey, you don't have to shout.
108.600  We're just trying to help you out.
111.320  Oh.
113.160  Oh.
114.200  Oh.
114.360  Okay, it's time you know this is just a video.
118.640  I don't drink or pee in sinks.
120.500  It's what I want my fans to think.
122.600  It's all an act.
123.800  And in fact, it's even in my contract.
127.380  Oh.
127.960  Oh.

181.620  I am Kim Jong Un and I'm not here to amuse ya.
185.940  No, not Kim Jong Il.
187.640  Sorry for the confusion.
189.360  Everybody say South Korea makes the best K -pop.
192.760  But you know who does a better job?
195.680  Do you?
196.400  I'll give you a guess.
197.800  It's a country whose number one export is nuclear tests.
201.840  The national pastime of the people is to be oppressed.
205.440  Did you guess North Korea?
206.900  Congrats, cause you are the best.
208.920  You passed the test.
210.940  And I'm the leader, the great successor.
214.520  Who'd have known?
216.200  I should have known.
217.600  I run for office.
219.920  But who'd oppose me?
222.180  Any of you?
223.600  How about you?

252.840  Fire, fire, shoot, fire, fire.
255.540  Wiping out hostiles.
258.680  And nobody's lazy.
260.620  Work, work, sleep, then work, torture.
264.100  I think you thought that Kim Jong -Age was almost done.
267.520  But just like friends or Seinfeld, it is only a rerun.
270.940  Because I'm just like my father and his father, Kim Il -sung.
274.640  Except they call me Kim Jong -Fan, number one.
278.100  I got awesome hair.
279.480  My daddy wielded to me because I'm his awesome hair.
283.200  You should come to North Korea because we have awesome hair.
286.900  In fact, it's the only thing we have to eat because food is scarce.
290.620  Check in on Boss Quar.
292.480  I'm like the Beatles.
294.420  I make the people cry and scream.
297.920  See what I mean?

344.240  Hey, dude, I'm trying.
366.240  Here's how we created our Pets Tubs app for a class project.
369.520  First, the brush.
370.820  Now the lasso for tweaking.
397.860  I can't tell her that I like her.
400.140  I can only shoot her with the spitball.
402.360  She should know that it means the same thing after all.
405.000  I threw glue at her just to get a reaction.
407.560  She was a distraction from addition and fraction.
410.180  I threw a picture of her because I thought she was neat.
413.100  We've always been close because we have assigned seats.
415.880  I'll never forget when I passed her that note because she checked the box, yes, and that's all that she wrote.
421.400  From then it was great and we had a play date.
423.840  We played house and she made me a fake Plato strip.
426.220  The next day I saw something that I'll never forget.
429.440  She was playing and laying with Kyle in the ball pit.
432.420  I started to cry and lay down on the floor.
434.920  I said, you're a fart face, I don't like you no more.
437.640  I want you out of my heart, but you're stuck like a splinter.
440.480  Goodbye, my mom's calling me for dinner.
442.600  You said mean things and you ran away.
448.420  That's okay, it must have been a busy day.
453.380  You stole my heart and you stole my bike.
459.060  That's all right because I love the way you like.
464.160  I love the way you like.
467.380  Now I apologize for wiping boogers on your jacket and backpack.
471.060  I wish that it didn't, I wish that I could backtrack to the day before they made me sit in the corner.
476.500  This feels like a third grade restraining order.
479.300  I knew that I loved you at first, but I fought it.
482.000  My heart was a kickball, then you suddenly caught it.
484.860  I'm sorry, but there's something I must confess.
487.200  It was me who ripped off your Nintendo DS.
490.080  I felt bad and returned it while you were busy nabbing.
492.980  We're together again, it's just like it never happened.
495.880  I dressed up as Weasley and you were Hermione.
498.640  You said you had spells that could make me less whiny.
501.360  You colored inside of the lines of my heart because you opened me up and then you cut a fart in my heart.
507.180  I'm so bored with these games that we're playing.
509.460  I guess that's why they call them board games.
511.440  Well, I am rubber and you are glue.
516.820  Words bounce off of me and then stick on to you.
522.600  Did you just call me a doo -doo pie?
527.720  That's all right, I know you are, but what am I?
532.760  I know you are, but what am I?
540.940  Ducky of Awesome So I want to give a big thanks to the good people at La -Di -Da.

1728.500  Terms of life cancel any time.
1735.160  I'm ridiculous.
1736.660  My 15 minutes is almost up.
1738.480  I pulled this song out of my butt.
1740.460  Hit clubs like Jack Nicholas.
1742.540  Pretending I'm back here.
1743.720  I'm curious.
1744.520  Cause I think it's hilarious.
1746.520  This town's a zit.
1747.460  Let's squeeze the pus.
1748.480  Don't look at us like we're disgusting.
1751.380  I'm like Gaga with less grace.
1755.000  Can't read my TikTok blah blah face.
1759.120  Wake up in tubs but never babe.
1763.200  I just use Febreze.
1765.380  That's gross.
1766.500  I'm barfing up a lung.
1770.160  I'm making out with bum.
1774.380  I'm partying with nuns.
1778.480  I'm peeing in your yard.
1780.440  I'm trying too hard.
1783.120  Kesha, talk to us.
1784.420  There's something that we must discuss.
1786.500  It's about your lack of cleanliness.
1788.420  When you walk you'll leave a cloud of dust.
1790.780  Please girl take a bath and use some soap.
1793.520  Now here's a toothbrush and some scope.
1795.460  You don't understand what I'm about.
1797.280  Did something die inside your mouth?
1799.460  I'll sing like a drunk buffoon.
1803.100  Then it's fixed with autotune.
1807.080  Check out my new Kesha perfume.
1810.960  It smells like sex and shoes.
1813.480  That's gross.
1814.420  Hey let go of my arm.
1818.220  Hey that's my chicken arm.
1822.340  She's like a safer Nard.
1825.700  She's got a beetle in her ear.
1828.340  Don't kill my career.
1831.360  I'm melting.
1854.120  Leave a comment below.
1884.120  First of all this song is not as good as bad romance.
1888.220  And it's not even close to poker face or just dance.
1892.220  So I will distract them by getting half naked.
1896.040  And throw everything at them but the kitchen sink sink.
1899.900  The kitchen sink sink.
1901.900  What do you think think?
1904.100  I will prove that I don't have a penis wing wing.
1908.020  First I'll get stripped naked by some burly prison gods.
1911.440  And make out with the she -mell in the prison yard yard.
1915.700  This video seems goofy you should just do it alone.
1919.740  Besides I'm getting sick of all these songs about phones.
1923.760  You bail me out of jail then we fall.
1926.300  I smell some bad life love.
1927.920  We poison everyone including a cute doll.
1931.600  Then we start to dance and there's dead people everywhere.
1935.960  As usual I have lots of crazy crap in my hair.
1939.600  Pup pup pup pup product placement.
1943.420  Hide the dead bodies in the pup pup basement.
1947.500  Blood and guts and boobs and butts.
1949.140  And I just want to make your head explode.
1951.580  Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.
1952.980  That was Lady Gaga in more scope.
1955.300  If you think I'm doing this then you're a crazy bastard.
1959.180  You must have flown a gassing.
1961.260  Are you dripping on acid?
1963.180  As a child were you abused by some big crazy bastard.
1966.880  And did he ever make you place a lotion in the bath head.
1971.100  I just want to do a simple shoot with dancing.
1974.720  You used to be a diva now you're Marilyn Manson.
1978.600  You're gonna do my video and do it my way.
1982.520  I'd hate for something bad to happen to your family.
1986.480  My family, that's right Beyonce.
1990.580  Appearing on my accidentally fall on Jay -Z.
1995.000  Somebody help me cause I don't want to sing anymore.
1998.700  She's got a gun to my head on the dance floor.
2002.600  Brother dubbed up three nuns in a tub and they're doing it with the garden door.
2006.140  Please don't beat me up I don't have to ask what doesn't have to do with a telephone.
2010.280  You crazy bitch.
2014.820  AHHHHH and don't forget to subscribe.
2083.980  Is this reality or just a fever dream?
2088.000  I like to jerk and twitch, this is how I dance.
2092.180  It's cold in here, may I please put on some pants?
2095.780  No!
2095.840  Sheek, freak, sister fierce, work those bitchy gans.
2099.820  Those were just some words that only gay men understand.
2103.980  Blah blah blah, woo hoo hee, everybody look at me.
2107.920  Random stuff, random stuff, tell me have you had enough?
2111.780  If I love you and you love me, then maybe how can we go wrong?
2120.820  This chorus doesn't have anything to do with the rest of the song.
2126.400  Completely unrelated.
2128.300  I'm Lady Gaga and I'm Lord Gaga.
2132.160  Sometimes we like to sing like we are underwater.
2136.400  You think you're weird girl, but I'm weirder than you.
2139.720  Let me tell you of the weird things that I like to do.
2144.400  Yesterday I went to church and made out with a nun.
2148.120  Then I went up to the roof and stared into the sun.
2152.200  That is pretty weird, but I think I got to beat.
2156.360  I like to wear bathing suits made out of raw meat.
2160.420  I put on a tuxedo before I go to bed.
2164.260  I send out birthday cards to people who are dead.
2167.920  I like to eat Brillo Pads, that's how I got this voice.
2172.420  Sometimes I like to cut myself, but it's a fashion choice.
2177.300  If I love you and you love me, then maybe how can we go wrong?
2185.420  We're totally making this shit up as we go along.
2191.060  I'm not over dying.
2194.300  Duckie of Awesome.

2223.300  I'm a medical student, all I do is study, so you can trust me.
2226.840  I've used Grammarly for forever.
2229.080  One of the big songs.
2289.340  I'm like stretch Armstrong.
2291.800  Feast on my tofu.
2294.000  Is this supposed to be sexy?
2295.500  I need to be deflowered.
2298.040  My clam needs your chowder.
2299.700  Your filthy brain needs a shower.
2301.840  Cause I'm not coursing technically.
2304.780  Gonna fuck your banana.
2306.920  If you get what I'm after.
2308.700  You would think I ain't Nebraska.
2311.080  Because my shit is so corny.
2314.020  I know I'm slim shady.
2315.600  Welcome back to Pop Chef.
2316.800  Let's see what our judges have to say.
2318.280  KD must be high.
2320.520  Perhaps she lost her mind.
2323.320  Using too much damn cheese.
2325.420  Coulda used more time.
2327.560  The sexy piece of candy has matured.
2329.740  Into a horny foodie connoisseur.
2331.640  She told me this is Kobe but it's striped.
2334.060  But I have to say the melon fool looks like a poet.
2336.840  I prefer KD Fairy Ballad on some poppy.
2338.980  The missing ingredient with talent.
2340.400  Now she wildin.
2341.100  I'm trying to be a female DJ Colin.
2343.160  And I just to be my hecka disagrees with my palette.
2345.700  Thumbs down, not impressed.
2347.320  Surprise you didn't steal Lady Gaga's meat dress.
2350.260  Has anybody seen a waitress?
2352.140  No, cause Migos need separate checks.
2354.300  I'll call the chauffeur.
2355.960  This thing doesn't work.
2356.920  Now I'm super hungry.
2358.880  I guess I could just eat me.
2361.220  Besides who really needs feet?
2363.020  This song is all about the place.
2366.040  Made too many food puns.
2367.960  I've got food pun poison on.

2517.400  What's going on?
2519.700  I see your thumb.
2521.840  Girl, did you know that I've got the same one on, on, on?
2525.520  We're on the beach doing a sport.

2568.080  You'll wake up at night screaming na -na, na -na.
2571.620  My grandmother's nickname is Na -Na.
2575.140  And now I'll point to the place where you make babies.
2579.180  I want somebody to grow old and point with me.
2582.920  I like the fact that we wear the same size capris.
2586.920  I don't know, oh, oh.
2589.460  I don't know that I'm gay yet.
2591.760  Someday he'll come out of the closet.
2594.480  In five years I will OD on heroin.
2598.340  One of us will be the Justin.

2689.640  Music I'm gonna tell you the story of a reggae shark.
2716.840  There are hundreds of sharks living under the sea.
2720.640  Great whites, hammerheads, and white -tipped reefs.
2723.280  But the one shark discovery always leave out is the dreadlocked rasta fish I'm talking about.
2729.540  Reggae Shark!
2730.040  Reggae Shark is real!
2732.180  Reggae Shark!
2733.000  He's got a band with the Sears.

2738.960  He just want ya gunja!
2741.120  Reggae Shark!
2741.960  Up the darts, Reggae Shark come cruising!
2744.460  Some say Reggae Shark's part human.
2747.460  Him was cursed by an evil jelly witch.
2750.400  Didn't have no reason, she was just a bitch.
2753.460  Some kids were boating and smoking a spliff.
2756.240  Reggae Shark swam over to ask for a hit.
2759.500  The kids start screaming and one of them drowned.
2762.200  Now the sheriff and his bossy gonna hunt him down.
2765.260  Reggae Shark!
2765.860  He's got no political agenda!
2768.280  Reggae Shark!
2769.040  He just wants redemption!
2771.120  Reggae Shark!
2772.160  And he also wants gunja!
2774.340  But you can't light a spliff when you live under water.
2777.600  One day a drug boat had a drop its load.
2780.440  Reggae Shark come along and him ate it whole.
2783.260  Now he's starving like Marvin Catamont cheese.
2786.400  Then him see the evil sheriff and all his flunkies.
2789.120  He put his fins in the air, said it wasn't me fault.
2792.220  But the sheriff set fire and the rifle shot.
2796.240  But it was just a shark decoy tied to a raft.
2799.760  Cause the Reggae Shark's a master of darts and crafts.
2803.000  Reggae Shark!
2803.860  He jumped on the boat and the sheriff fell down his throat.
2809.100  The townspeople cheered and said you brought us peace.
2811.740  You took a bite of corruption in the town police.
2814.980  They threw him a huge ticker tape parade.
2817.780  Cause they know that the balance is da food chain.
2821.040  They gave him the key to Kingston town.
2823.760  You should see the tourism it brings in now.
2826.760  You've redeemed yourself, said the jelly witch.
2829.500  Me can reverse that curse and I grant your wish.
2832.980  Him looked at the witch and he said nay.
2835.760  Cause I'm a Reggae Shark and that's the way I'll stay.
2838.800  Reggae Shark!
2839.460  Reggae Shark!
2840.220  Reggae Shark!

3915.040  Now it feels like such a goon She's feeling like a moon goon I guess you got sort of skeeved by His girlfriend from the moon I'm so sorry that I broke your hearts When I ran from your alien lady parts Now I'm back at school getting hung on a shelf They're grabbing my hand saying don't hate yourself I'm slurping down life from a bitter spoon And missing my girlfriend from the moon From the moon Grachnia, if you can hear me out there I'm sorry, I just freaked out It's not you, it's me It's not you, it's him This pain I'm feeling is worse than I felt After seeing the Phantom Menace The Phantom Menace really sucks Except for Dark Moon I just was intimidated by your three vaginas Mary, Curly, and Moe I would fight all the orcs and mordor just to have you back Boo In space, no one can hear you cry Boo This is f***ing nerd s*** You You You We double -dealed Derry to try Sonic's new Pickle Rita slush You wanna live free?
4078.360  Dark Horse Oh no!
4084.460  These lyrics are wack!
4085.520  Dark Horse means unknown challenger who comes from behind in a competition, yo That don't mean having magical powers or have anything to do with ancient Egypt Didn't anybody proofread this?
4094.820  Whatever Juicy J, Katy Perry, let's get paid!
4097.940  I'm really smart I know about Easter eggs This work of art Is a documentary John Mayo Is a jerk Lord Dene He's not a mayor Of anything I am a witchy Dark Horse You don't understand metaphors Yes I do It's what happens when you met a moth I took a course And worked on the tray Baby you could be my locksmith Cause having safe sex is what I'm all about But if you ever try to milk me I'll chew and spit you out just like a mad cow Nope Omega Quake I got work Where is she going with this?
4146.980  By using my horse power Wrong, F I get comments from a Trojan horse Can someone explain all the horse expressions to her?
4154.980  I can help with that Uh, a rocking horse That's for a kid A talking horse That's Mr.
4163.320  Ed Be careful Stretch after exercise Or you could get a charley horse that cramps up both your thighs Don't put the cart for the horse up You'll do things out of order When you think it's the same but it turns out different as a horse of another color A one horse town has a small population If you hold your horses in music that is called a retardation Myla's already working with Nelly Justin got Jay -Z And if Gaga wasn't with our Kelly I'd change horses midstream You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink You can lead a horticulture but you can't make a thing The rest of you can get the F out I don't even care what a manna is for I think I should end this song now I don't wanna fog it like a dead horse Wait!
4216.560  You finally got one right A plus My heart of stone's filled with pride Cold, star I see the light at the end of The horse?

4312.440  These lyrics are wack Dark Horse means unknown challenger who comes from behind in a competition yo That don't mean having magical powers I don't wanna come home with the homecoming queen And those Artie Guth girls are too freaky for me I don't want a nice girl who's good in the kitchen I want an Amazon babe from another dimension She's got skimpy armor and a sword to match She never gets cold and she never gets a scratch She fights off ninjas a hundred at a time But that's okay Cause they're waiting in line When she swings her sword she looks smoking hot Dodging bullets cause they're lousy shots I'm addicted but I don't want an intervention From my Amazon babe from another dimension Amazon babe from another dimension All the barbarians stand at attention Amazon babe from another dimension Not like the ones at the comic convention The girl I want is made out of metal and tubes She's a sexy cyborg with adjustable boobs She's got skinny arms but they're totally whale And leaping tall buildings while she checks the details Got a gatling gun and a radar detector When she needs repairs I'm the gadget inspector If I was a teacher I'd give an extension To my sexy cyborg from another dimension Sexy cyborg from another dimension One more thing I forgot to mention Sexy cyborg from another dimension Another recommendation for those with hypertension So we read about an ancient tribal rite And performed it at an Indian burial site Opened up an intergalactic wormhole And out came ladies who were out of control She's alive!
4448.580  But my Amazon won't play video games And she's only interested in talking to dames My robot looks hot on the movie posters But I came home from school and caught her f***ing the toaster I used that So far I've gotten no action at all This is not how it went for Anthony Michael Hall You've got a beautiful face and you're totally stacked But if we can't have sex I'd like my room back Sexy cyborg from another dimension One more week and you have to leave Amazon leave from another dimension You even had sex with my cousin Steve?
4480.340  Now this stupid wormhole is open Letting it all manner a flotsam Biker, zombies, giant squids Man in humanities Charlton Heston We should have just watched porn Should have watched porn, should have watched porn

600.640  Yum, yum, give me.
603.000  Hey audience, what was my motivation behind Nugget in a Biscuit artistically?
607.220  Nugget in a Biscuit was my, what's the word that means the best thing you've ever done up to this point in your career?
613.300  Magnum opus.
614.080  It was like my magnum opus and I just couldn't wait to unleash this song upon the world.
618.800  Because I think the world needed a song about putting nuggets in biscuits and just dipping that whole thing in mashed potatoes.
625.800  The barbecue sauce, that was just kind of freestyled into there.
628.240  But I don't think it detracted from the points I wanted to make, which was nugget, biscuit, sandwich, dip it in mashed potatoes.
633.760  So I think it was a success artistically.
635.400  What's that Steven?
636.420  iTunes sales of Nugget in a Biscuit?
637.520  Go to help me replace my computer that died last week?
639.820  That's the best cause ever.
641.480  Moment of silence.

1597.880  Somebody I know.
1598.700  Somebody I don't even know anymore.
1599.640  I don't hang out.
1600.320  It's just so weird that you did that.
1602.500  Steven, edit that part out.
1603.440  Edit the whole part out about me talking about taking the character's clothes.
1606.300  He left it in.
1607.340  Speaking of taking clothes off, I'm in a new promotion for Oliveology with Wheezy Waiter in which we both take our shirts off.
1613.180  Check it out.
1614.300  First link in the description.
1614.880  You're welcome in advance.
1617.000  Also, my posters of darkness and redness and whiteness are now back in stock.
1622.540  Darkness.
1623.600  This is black, not the band.
1625.120  It's the color.
1626.580  If you want to order those, click the link in the description.
1629.160  Mine's not signed.
1630.620  It's way too expensive.
1631.640  I'm going to break this in this video.
1634.160  Bless your face.
1635.160  If you sneeze during this video, bless you.
1637.660  Peace off.

1673.380  Yes, it helps me focus.
1676.280  You realize you just wrote that down.
1677.800  Oh, sorry, Santa.
1679.680  That was to gay buskis.
1682.860  I've been very good this year, and all I want is the gun from Portal.
1690.680  Ah, okay.
1691.440  Amen, Toby.
1692.680  Don't put amen on that.
1694.340  Amen is for Jesus.

1697.420  And done.

1787.480  Wow, it's a replica.
1789.700  I need the real one, Buscus.
1792.180  I still have to go to China.
1794.080  China, huh?
1795.420  I have an idea.
1800.460  No, Toby, naughty, naughty!
1805.340  No need to thank me.

1821.080  Run!
1821.940  Okay, you don't gotta yell.
1823.600  Geez.
1824.640  Isn't being alive what life is all about?
1842.700  Get Buscus!
1844.620  Adventures!
1847.240  Ah!
1847.980  Let me guess, you're bored.
1849.500  No, that's just how I breathe sometimes.
1851.340  When you're bored?
1852.200  Yes.
1853.040  Hey, get Buscus, could you call my mom real quick?
1856.000  What?
1856.520  No!
1856.940  But it's her birthday.
1858.220  Yes, so you should call her.
1859.480  What if she talks about Farmvale?
1861.060  Call your mom.
1862.060  Yeah, well, you know how phones usually have those things where you have to call your mom or you have a plan and you get service?
1866.180  What are they called?
1866.740  Service plans?
1867.600  Yeah, I don't have one of those.
1869.140  Why?
1869.500  They wanted to lock me into a contract.
1871.600  So?
1871.880  So, I don't like signing documents.
1873.880  Why not, Tobuscus?
1874.800  What if they try to sell my signature?
1877.580  The more stuff I sign, the more my signature goes down in value.
1882.780  I don't think it can be worth less than worthless.
1886.080  Everyone's laughing.
1887.100  Anyway, I'm never gonna sign another contract again.
1889.660  So you're just not gonna have a phone anymore?
1891.540  Au contraire.
1892.540  There is a company that doesn't make you sign a term contract.
1895.420  Where?
1896.260  Canada.
1897.140  No term contract.
1898.260  Why do you get promotional mail from Canada?
1900.020  I'm open -minded.
1901.120  But you're not in Canada.
1902.360  Not yet.
1903.280  Steven!
1903.900  Order us some da - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1905.100  If I don't call your mom, you're gonna go to Canada.
1907.380  Yes.
1907.800  You think the value of your signature would go down more than the price of two tickets to Canada?
1911.840  Ostensibly.
1912.480  That word doesn't work there.
1913.780  Steven!
1914.560  Tickets!
1917.320  You don't look so happy, Tobuscus.
1919.200  Here, have some peanuts.
1920.340  I'm fine.
1921.120  Mmm, they're good.
1921.840  Look at them peanuts.
1923.480  Mmm.
1923.880  Mmm.
1924.500  Turn around.
1925.440  You sure you don't want a peanut?
1927.360  I don't want any peanuts.
1928.780  Okay, more for me.
1929.620  Excuse me, how did I - could I get some more peanuts, please?
1931.880  Thank you.
1932.640  Here you go, just in case.
1934.380  Ow!

1935.920  Wow!
1936.540  It's like a different planet.
1937.880  Nope, not at all.
1938.640  I feel heavier.
1939.500  Gravity must be stronger here.
1940.720  Yeah, or you ate 37 bags of peanuts.
1943.120  Oh yeah.
1943.760  Hey, can I borrow your phone?
1945.000  For what?
1945.680  Uh, to set up my new service.
1947.500  Unless you wanna do it.
1948.920  Do your best me voice.
1950.960  Look at me, I'm Tobuscus!
1952.840  Blah blah blah!
1953.700  Oh, that's terrible.
1956.840  Thanks for calling, Rogers.
1957.580  How can I help you?
1958.580  Wait, are you Canadian?

1971.140  Uh -huh.
1971.280  It's about $35 a month for unlimited Canada -wide text and talk.
1974.740  Thirty -five Canadian dollars?
1977.000  Yeah.
1977.560  Per Canadian month.
1979.300  Wow.
1979.780  Yeah, that's a lot.

2203.900  People die.
2204.880  That's a callback.
2205.960  This is the longest he's ever gone without killing anyone.
2210.240  In wonders of his future, some will carry out the tradition of killing everyone he sees.
2214.760  It's his lunch break, luckily.
2216.620  Toast of a quality.
2218.160  Hurry with the toast, there's a drunken hawker walking to the right.

2239.360  Take a second to sober up.
2241.140  No tolerance.

2246.160  Sees hooded man's little arm open signal.
2247.960  Which tells him to go make a toast with the people.
2250.640  And then he heads off then though.

2269.820  Hooded man feels good.
2271.660  Hey, don't touch the hood.
2273.620  If you try to stab the hoodless man, he'll stab you in the abdomen.
2278.460  And steal your wallet.
2281.560  And uh, look right.
2283.720  Colonial running shoe commercial.
2286.240  They thought they could catch the boat.

2310.320  In the cabin at the boat.
2312.460  Shoot four, only two go through.
2315.340  Maybe two would blank.
2316.900  Strike a pose.
2318.120  Edward turns the boat.
2319.660  Red cloaked captain probably should have let that bird boat go.
2325.780  Oh no, cannon's not shooting brains anymore.

2354.280  I prefer my murder hood.
2356.200  People die cause I look so good.
2358.380  Drop the pistols, throw a stick.

2447.860  I'm bored.
2448.900  Why don't you go outside?
2450.780  Because I have allergies and the zombies took over the world yesterday and I'm just tired.
2454.860  Wait, what was that, middle one?
2455.640  Oh, I have allergies.
2456.500  After that?
2456.920  Oh, I'm just really sleepy.
2457.840  Before that?
2458.400  Oh, zombies took over the world and everyone's dead.
2460.060  What are you talking about?
2461.600  These guys.
2469.260  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
2470.460  Why didn't you say something?!
2471.700  I tried to yesterday.
2473.100  Hey ,ışłobieczek, a cockspots?
2474.020  No.
2474.780  Okay.
2476.060  Telling someone zombies took over the world is not a guess what situation.
2480.640  Aaaaaaaaaaa!
2482.520  What are you doing?
2484.020  Starting an Indiegogo campaign.
2485.760  What is Indiegogo?
2486.800  Oh, it's like Kickstarter, but indie and with more gogos.
2489.520  You're starting a fundraising campaign?!
2491.220  You bet your bucket I am.
2492.800  That's not even a saying!
2493.680  I was thinking we could raise money for weapons so we could defeat the zombies.
2495.960  No one is going to donate.
2497.580  Everyone is dead.
2498.940  Oh, sweet, we got our first donation!
2501.180  $50.
2501.940  What?
2502.780  Uh -oh!
2503.480  Here, take this.
2504.220  What is this?
2504.720  I said if they donated $50, you'd kill a zombie with a fork.
2507.240  You can't tell them I'm gonna do so.
2508.980  Think fast.
2511.140  Nice.
2512.360  Oh man, they're rolling in now.
2518.060  Nicely done, gay butt, right here.
2519.760  This was a horrible plan.
2522.100  Whoa, somebody just donated $500.
2524.100  What do I have to do for $500?
2525.540  Gay Boscous, it's not always about you.

2566.440  Oh, good idea.
2567.260  If we raise enough, Gay Boscous might even help some too a little.
2572.500  And start campaign.
2574.420  And now we wait.
2575.660  You just started the campaign?
2577.160  Yep.

2665.600  I don't know.
2666.260  Maybe because I keep being bored.
2668.360  Then go do something.
2669.520  Ooh, good idea.
2670.120  Let's get some coffee.
2671.020  Yeah, that's what you need.
2672.020  Caffeine.

2674.020  We're like in the same wavelength.
2674.900  How about you get some coffee and I'll stay here?
2676.920  I don't want to go by myself.
2678.160  What if I get recognized?
2679.580  You love getting recognized.
2680.860  Not always.
2681.640  Remember that one time?
2682.600  Hey, is that you, Toboska?
2683.980  Sure is.
2684.560  Could you sign my shirt?
2685.820  Yup, just come on over to this side of the street.
2687.760  Okay, I'll be right there.
2689.200  Make sure to look both ways.

2696.380  I think I'm gonna go incognito buskus this time, just in case.
2699.360  What does that mean?
2700.080  Oh, it's when I wear a Tobuska shirt inside out.
2702.340  And what's the point of that?
2703.180  Uh, so it doesn't say Tobuska -s, duh.
2705.340  Yeah, so just wear a plain shirt that doesn't say Tobuska -s.
2707.800  A plain shirt.
2709.460  Ha ha ha.

3064.500  Oh, we're going to jail!
3067.280  Excuse me, did you do that?
3068.820  No.
3069.420  Yes, I did.
3070.240  Shut up.
3070.640  The person that hijacked that Dr.
3072.460  Pepper 10 truck was about to blow up the moon.
3075.360  You just saved the planet.
3076.780  What?
3077.280  I know.

3078.220  No, you didn't know?
3079.100  Would you mind stepping into the car?
3080.940  The president would like a word.
3082.400  What?
3083.000  Uh, fine.
3084.160  Am I dreaming?
3085.820  What?

3086.980  Gentlemen, I...
3088.180  Whoa!
3088.540  He said you wanted one word.
3090.140  Mr.
3090.340  President, I'm sorry about him.
3091.320  He's actually slow.
3092.140  No, it's alright.
3092.880  He should have been more specific.
3094.780  Forgiven.
3095.680  I'd like to thank you for saving the planet.
3098.120  All in a day's work, Mr.
3099.260  President.
3100.000  What?
3100.660  To buskus, this is the president of Dr.
3102.780  Pepper 10.
3103.260  Oh, hello, other Mr.
3104.400  President.
3104.820  You blew up one of our trucks, but you also prevented the Dr.
3108.740  Pepper 10 brand from being associated with the destruction of our moon.
3112.280  How could we ever repay you for that?
3114.480  Hmm.
3114.920  Make me not bored.
3118.060  How about we send you on the manliest adventure ever?
3120.480  Whoa!
3120.980  We'll call it the man -venture!
3123.460  Venture, venture.
3124.480  That's the best thing I've ever heard in my life.
3126.660  You're on, other Mr.
3128.100  President.
3128.620  Then it's settled.
3129.420  But you have to drink Dr.
3130.500  Pepper 10 the whole time.
