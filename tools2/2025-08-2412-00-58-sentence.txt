600.640  Yum, yum, give me.
603.000  Hey audience, what was my motivation behind Nugget in a Biscuit artistically?
607.220  Nugget in a Biscuit was my, what's the word that means the best thing you've ever done up to this point in your career?
613.300  Magnum opus.
614.080  It was like my magnum opus and I just couldn't wait to unleash this song upon the world.
618.800  Because I think the world needed a song about putting nuggets in biscuits and just dipping that whole thing in mashed potatoes.
625.800  The barbecue sauce, that was just kind of freestyled into there.
628.240  But I don't think it detracted from the points I wanted to make, which was nugget, biscuit, sandwich, dip it in mashed potatoes.
633.760  So I think it was a success artistically.
635.400  What's that Steven?
636.420  iTunes sales of Nugget in a Biscuit?
637.520  Go to help me replace my computer that died last week?
639.820  That's the best cause ever.
641.480  Moment of silence.
642.440  Done.
642.720  Is it already available on iTunes?
643.880  It is.

651.080  That's weird.
652.200  I'm going to go get a nugget now because I'm kind of hungry.
654.220  Possibly a biscuit as well.
655.320  Maybe some mashed potatoes and then dip the first two into the third.
657.980  Bless your face.

1582.640  I don't know why I throw myself in the frame at the beginning.
1584.080  It doesn't even make any sense.
1584.900  Why would I?
1585.380  I'm just sitting.
1585.820  There's a chair.
1586.340  There's obviously a chair.

1596.740  I didn't do that.
1597.880  Somebody I know.
1598.700  Somebody I don't even know anymore.
1599.640  I don't hang out.
1600.320  It's just so weird that you did that.
1602.500  Steven, edit that part out.
1603.440  Edit the whole part out about me talking about taking the character's clothes.
1606.300  He left it in.
1607.340  Speaking of taking clothes off, I'm in a new promotion for Oliveology with Wheezy Waiter in which we both take our shirts off.

1664.360  Dear Santa, I have been a very good buskis this year.
1671.140  Do you have to read that out loud while you're writing?
1673.380  Yes, it helps me focus.
1676.280  You realize you just wrote that down.
1677.800  Oh, sorry, Santa.
1679.680  That was to gay buskis.
1682.860  I've been very good this year, and all I want is the gun from Portal.
1690.680  Ah, okay.
1691.440  Amen, Toby.
1692.680  Don't put amen on that.
1694.340  Amen is for Jesus.
1695.120  Good, now they both know what to get me.
1697.420  And done.
1698.560  Gay buskis, could you put this in the mailbox for me real quick?
1702.400  Sure.
1708.380  I'm bo - What?

1728.620  Oh!
1729.840  Oh!
1731.060  Oh!
1732.080  Sleep, you can do this.
1734.000  Just like we practiced every single night.
1738.480  That doesn't help.
1739.740  Come on, just pretend you're in class.
1741.900  Ah, learning.
1743.080  Ah!
1743.960  Oh!

1755.120  Oh, yeah!
1757.000  No, Toby, that's mine.
1759.520  It replaced my sleigh in 2007.
1762.880  Oh, got it.
1763.880  So, is mine in one of those boxes or what?
1765.760  Why don't you find out?
1770.000  Oh, yeah!
1772.160  Replica?
1773.100  What's that mean?
1773.780  Well, it's not real.
1775.760  Oh.
1778.420  I only have, stop, stop that.
1781.280  I only have this one.
1782.920  Oh, that's fine.
1783.280  I'll just take that one.
1784.060  You can have, you can have this one.
1787.480  Wow, it's a replica.
1789.700  I need the real one, Buscus.
1792.180  I still have to go to China.
1794.080  China, huh?
1795.420  I have an idea.
1800.460  No, Toby, naughty, naughty!
1805.340  No need to thank me.
1806.680  Now, where was I?
1809.260  Huh!
1809.820  Ah!
1810.280  Ah!
1810.940  Ah!
1812.520  Merry Christmas.
1814.240  What in the fuck?
1817.820  Subscribe.
1819.460  No, no, no, no, no.
1821.080  Run!
1821.940  Okay, you don't gotta yell.
1823.600  Geez.
1824.640  Isn't being alive what life is all about?
1842.700  Get Buscus!
1844.620  Adventures!
1847.240  Ah!
1847.980  Let me guess, you're bored.
1849.500  No, that's just how I breathe sometimes.
1851.340  When you're bored?
1852.200  Yes.
1853.040  Hey, get Buscus, could you call my mom real quick?
1856.000  What?
1856.520  No!
1856.940  But it's her birthday.
1858.220  Yes, so you should call her.
1859.480  What if she talks about Farmvale?
1861.060  Call your mom.
1862.060  Yeah, well, you know how phones usually have those things where you have to call your mom or you have a plan and you get service?
1866.180  What are they called?
1866.740  Service plans?
1867.600  Yeah, I don't have one of those.
1869.140  Why?
1869.500  They wanted to lock me into a contract.
1871.600  So?
1871.880  So, I don't like signing documents.
1873.880  Why not, Tobuscus?
1874.800  What if they try to sell my signature?
1877.580  The more stuff I sign, the more my signature goes down in value.
1882.780  I don't think it can be worth less than worthless.
1886.080  Everyone's laughing.
1887.100  Anyway, I'm never gonna sign another contract again.
1889.660  So you're just not gonna have a phone anymore?
1891.540  Au contraire.
1892.540  There is a company that doesn't make you sign a term contract.
1895.420  Where?
1896.260  Canada.
1897.140  No term contract.
1898.260  Why do you get promotional mail from Canada?
1900.020  I'm open -minded.
1901.120  But you're not in Canada.
1902.360  Not yet.
1903.280  Steven!
1903.900  Order us some da - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1905.100  If I don't call your mom, you're gonna go to Canada.
1907.380  Yes.
1907.800  You think the value of your signature would go down more than the price of two tickets to Canada?
1911.840  Ostensibly.
1912.480  That word doesn't work there.
1913.780  Steven!
1914.560  Tickets!
1917.320  You don't look so happy, Tobuscus.
1919.200  Here, have some peanuts.
1920.340  I'm fine.
1921.120  Mmm, they're good.
1921.840  Look at them peanuts.
1923.480  Mmm.
1923.880  Mmm.
1924.500  Turn around.
1925.440  You sure you don't want a peanut?
1927.360  I don't want any peanuts.
1928.780  Okay, more for me.
1929.620  Excuse me, how did I - could I get some more peanuts, please?
1931.880  Thank you.
1932.640  Here you go, just in case.
1934.380  Ow!
1934.900  We made it!
1935.920  Wow!

2214.760  It's his lunch break, luckily.
2216.620  Toast of a quality.

2489.520  You're starting a fundraising campaign?!
2491.220  You bet your bucket I am.
2492.800  That's not even a saying!
2493.680  I was thinking we could raise money for weapons so we could defeat the zombies.
2495.960  No one is going to donate.
2497.580  Everyone is dead.
2498.940  Oh, sweet, we got our first donation!
2501.180  $50.
2501.940  What?

2504.720  I said if they donated $50, you'd kill a zombie with a fork.
2507.240  You can't tell them I'm gonna do so.
2508.980  Think fast.

2572.500  And start campaign.
2574.420  And now we wait.
2575.660  You just started the campaign?
2577.160  Yep.

3092.140  No, it's alright.
3092.880  He should have been more specific.
3094.780  Forgiven.
3095.680  I'd like to thank you for saving the planet.

3104.820  You blew up one of our trucks, but you also prevented the Dr.
3108.740  Pepper 10 brand from being associated with the destruction of our moon.
3112.280  How could we ever repay you for that?
3114.480  Hmm.
